## Getting Started

### Installation

The extension needs to be installed as any other extension of TYPO3 CMS:
1. Switch to the module “Extension Manager”.
2. Get the extension
    1. **Get it from the Extension Manager**: Press the “Retrieve/Update” button, search for the extension key cf_beskin and import the extension from the repository.
    2. **Get it from typo3.org**: You can always get current version from [https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/cf_beskin/](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/cf_beskin/) by downloading either the t3x or zip version. Upload the file afterwards in the Extension Manager.

### Usage

After installing and activating the extension you'll notice a new entry in your backend navigation, called "Backend Skin".
