What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides a simple yet powerful way for owners of TYPO3 based websites
to easily customize the backend styling, without making any changes to core files or
writing unnecessary TypoScripts.
The containing backend module provides a high performance code editor - called ACE -
which allows you to develop your own CSS rule-sets on top of the standard TYPO3 stylesheet.
